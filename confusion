x a set
 [a ∈ x] valid syntax

s a set, [s] a set
  1 ∈ [s]
  x, y ∈ [s] => x + y ∈ [s]
  x + y + z = (x + y) + z
  1 + x = x + 1 = x


let s be a set. _

let s1 and s2 be sets. the product of s1 and s2 , s1 × s2, is
  the set of pairs (x, y) where x ∈ s1 and y ∈ s2.


x : s1
y : s2
(x, y) : s1 × s2

let s be a set. a product on s is a function f : [s] -> s and an element e ∈ s
 such that
  f [] = e
  f [x] = x
  f (xs + ys) = f [f xs, f ys]

  f [e, x] = f [f [], f [x]] = f ([] + [x]) = f [x] = x

let s be a set. a product on s is a function f : s -> s -> s and an element e ∈ s
 such that
  f a (f b c) = f (f a b) c
  f a e = f e a = a



unification equality vs mathematical equality?
 - u e acts on references to objects
 - proving a nontrivial a = b allows use of 'the', u e


let x, y ∈ X. the element of X × X is diagonal if x = y.
let [x, y] ∈ X.
